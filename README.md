# share.file

A lightweight Windows application that allows you to instantly share files from your computer to any device on your local network by simply scanning a QR code.

## Download

**[üì• Download Latest Release (Windows x64)](https://github.com/sheuronazxe/sharefile/raw/refs/heads/main/release-x64/sharefile.exe)**

*No installation required - just download and run!*

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Simply drag any file into the application window
- **Automatic QR Code Generation**: Instantly generates a QR code containing the download URL
- **Local Network Sharing**: Files are served over HTTP on your local network
- **Multi-file Support**: Navigate through multiple files with a single click
- **Customizable Port**: Choose your preferred HTTP port (default: 8080)
- **Automatic IP Detection**: Automatically detects your local IP address
- **Lightweight**: Small, fast, and no installation required

## How It Works

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `sharefile.exe`
2. **Set Your Port**: The default port is 8080, but you can change it if needed
3. **Drag & Drop**: Drag any file into the application window
4. **Scan QR Code**: Use your mobile device to scan the generated QR code
5. **Download**: Your device will automatically download the file

## Screenshots

*The application shows your local IP address and allows you to set a custom port. When you drag a file, it switches to QR code mode for easy scanning.*

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- Local network connection (WiFi or Ethernet)
- Device with QR code scanner (smartphone, tablet, etc.)

## Security Note

This application creates a temporary HTTP server on your local network. The server is only accessible from devices on the same network and automatically stops when you close the application or press ESC.

## Usage Tips

- **Multiple Files**: If you drag multiple files at once, click anywhere on the QR code to cycle through them
- **Port Selection**: Use ports between 1024-65535. Avoid common ports like 80, 443, or 8080 if they're already in use
- **Network Issues**: If the QR code doesn't work, ensure both devices are on the same network and no firewall is blocking the connection
- **Exit QR Mode**: Press ESC to return to the main interface
